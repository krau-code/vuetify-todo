Vuetify: Create an App with Vue JS by **Make Apps with Danny**

This is a duplicate website of what Danny did in his tutorial. The code is not mine, I just followed along with the video so I could understand the topic more.

The main purpose of this repository is to be my personal exercise for this topic.

Things that I added/changed:
* Added a "No Tasks" component when there are no tasks (I believe this is available in his full course with vuetify, but I just added it myself)
* Changed the title name
* Added a favicon
